CSC 4444 Homework 3 #3.

Author: Matthew Wolff

Dependencies
------------
Python >= 3.4 is required to run this project. Be sure your system supports 
that version. You may have to use a different ``python`` command to target the 
correct python installation.

Usage
-----

``python Main.py n m k``

As instructed in the homework:

``python Main.py 10 15 3``

``python Main.py 6 20 3``

A script is included to quickly run both commands and preserve output to ``run1.txt`` and ``run2.txt`` (``run.sh``)
